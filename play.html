<h3>WHITE DRESSES by Paul Greene</h3>
<h5>MARY.</h5>
<p>
     I couldn't do it. It'd kill her to leave here. You know it. She's
     been good to me all my life. Oh, I can't do it.
</p>
<p>
     [AUNT CANDACE _stealthily slips across the room and picks up the
     package from the bed, unseen by any one but_
</p>
<h5>MORGAN.</h5>
<p>
     Can't do it? Well, what you want me to do? Lose money on you
     till the end of time! You ain't earned enough to keep you in clothes for
     the last three years since Candace got down, an' ...
</p>
<p>
     [_A terrible cry rings out._ AUNT CANDACE _stands by the bed,
     holding a white dress up before her_. MORGAN _looks perplexed.
     Suddenly he starts back in astonishment._
</p>
<h5>MARY.</h5> 
<p>
     <p>[_Starting forward._]</p> It's for me! <p>[_Joyously._]</p> It's mine!
</p>
<h5>MORGAN.</h5>
<p>
     <p>[_Catching_ MARY _by the arm_.]</p> What--what is it?... Heigh!
     Don't you move, gal! Wait a minute!
</p>
<p>
     [_He pulls her back._ AUNT CANDACE _looks at_ MORGAN. _Gradually he
     lowers his head._
</p>
<h5>AUNT CANDACE.</h5>
<p>
     I's a-feared on it. I knowed it ... I knowed it. 
     <p>[_She throws the dress back on the bed and hobbles to the fire, groaning._]</p>
     Oh, Lawdy! Oh, Lawdy! My po' li'l gal! My po' li'l gal!
</p>
<p>
     [_She rocks to and fro._ MORGAN'S _hand falls from_ MARY'S
     _shoulder, and she runs to the bed_.
</p>
<h5>MARY.</h5>
<p>
     He sent it to me! He sent it to me! I knowed he wouldn't forget.
<p>[_She hugs the dress to her._</p>
<br>
<h5>MORGAN.</h5>
<p>
     <p> [_Turning to her._]</p> Well, and what nigger's sending you presents
     now? <p>[_With suspicion fully aroused._]</p> Who give you that, Mary!
</p>
<h5>MARY.</h5>
<p>
     He did!
</p>
<h5>MORGAN.</h5>
<p>
     <p>[_Sternly._]</p> Who?
</p>
<h5>MARY.</h5>
<p>
     <p>[_Impetuously._]</p> It was him! An' I don't care if you do know it!
</p>
<h5>MORGAN.</h5>
<p>
     Who? You don't mean ...
</p>
<h5>MARY.</h5>
<p>
     I do too--an' ...
</p>
<h5>MORGAN.</h5>
<p>
     God a'mighty, my ... it can't be so.
</p>
     <p>[MARY _goes to the window and holds the dress in front of her_.</p>
<h5>MARY.</h5>
<p>
     It is, too. Mr. Hugh sent it to me. <p>[MORGAN _groans_.]</p> He told me
     to-day he's sorry for me. I knowed he'd remember me; I knowed it. An',
     after all, I ain't been workin' the whole year for nothin'. He's got a
     heart if nobody else ain't.
</p>
<h5>MORGAN.</h5>
<p>
     What in the devil! I wonder ... Lord!
</p>
<p>
     [AUNT CANDACE _still looks in the fire. For a moment_ MORGAN
     _stands lost in abstraction, then he speaks fiercely_.
</p>
<h5>MORGAN.</h5>
<p>
     Mary, put them damned things up. Put 'em up, I say. <p>[_He goes
          toward her. She shrinks back; holding the dress to her. He snatches it
          from her and throws it on the bed, then he pushes her out in the middle
          of the floor. She wipes the tears from her eyes with her apron._]</p> You
     listen here, gal. We're goin' to settle it right here and now, once and
     for all. You're goin' to marry Jim?
